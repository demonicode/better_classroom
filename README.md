# better_classroom

We have developed an aid which help in the betterment of the education system. What we are proposing here is an application which will read the face expression of the students and with the help of them we can detect how interactive the class is going and if it is not too boring. The aid will notify the lecturer that the lecture is not going well and he needs to light up the mood.
It would also share the stats with the principal/director of the institution so they can assess the quality of their staff and in turn act accordingly.
We want to make learning more fun and engaging.
